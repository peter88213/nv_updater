# Operation

## Launch the program

- Open the update checker from the main menu: **Tools > Check for updates**.
- If an update is found, a message pops up. You can choose:
    - **Yes** starts your web browser with the update URL.
    - **No** skips this update.
    - **Cancel** cancels the update check.
- If no update is found, a message pops up at the end.

If a download directory is preset, all zip files with the downloaded releases will end up there. 
You then perform the actual installation manually as usual.
